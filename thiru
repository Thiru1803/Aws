REPORT
 Deploying a Web Server Using EC2 Instances

Introduction

The purpose of this report is to document the process of deploying a web server using Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances. This deployment involves setting up a scalable and reliable web hosting environment for hosting a website/application.

Objectives

To deploy a web server using Amazon EC2 instances.
To configure the instances for optimal performance and scalability.
To ensure high availability and reliability of the web server

Methodology

Step 1: Planning
Determined the requirements for the web server, including expected traffic, storage needs, and security considerations.
Chose the appropriate EC2 instance type based on the workload requirements and budget constraints.
Step 2: Instance Creation
Logged into the AWS Management Console and navigated to the EC2 dashboard.
Created EC2 instances with the selected specifications, including:
Instance type: [chosen type]
Operating system: [OS]
Security groups: Configured inbound/outbound rules for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
Key pairs: Generated and downloaded key pairs for SSH access.
Step 3: Configuration
Connected to the instances using SSH.
Installed necessary software and dependencies (e.g., web server software like Apache or Nginx, database if required, etc.).
Configured the web server settings, including ports, virtual hosts, and SSL certificates.
Set up monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch) for performance monitoring and alerts.
Step 4: Security and Scalability
Implemented security best practices, including:
Enabling firewall rules (using security groups) to restrict unnecessary access.
Configuring SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS communication.
Regularly updating the operating system and installed software for security patches.
Implemented auto-scaling configurations for handling increased traffic demands.
Results
Successfully deployed [number] EC2 instances to host the web server.
Configured the web server to handle [specify] concurrent users/requests.
Implemented security measures to safeguard against common threats.
Set up monitoring to track server performance and health metrics.
Challenges Faced
Identified challenges during the deployment process, such as initial setup complexities, security configurations, etc.
Overcame challenges by referring to AWS documentation, online resources, and utilizing AWS support if required.

Conclusion

The deployment of a web server using Amazon EC2 instances proved successful, meeting the objectives of creating a scalable, reliable, and secure hosting environment. The configured setup is ready to handle the expected web traffic and maintain high availability.

Recommendations

Regularly monitor and optimize the server performance for better efficiency.
Implement automated backups and disaster recovery strategies to prevent data loss.
Periodically review security configurations and apply updates to mitigate emerging threats.
